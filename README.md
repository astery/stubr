# Stubr

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leighshepperson/stubr.svg?branch=master)

In functional languages you should write pure functions. However, sometimes we need functions to call external APIâ€™s. But these affect the state of the system. So these functions are impure. In non-functional languages you create mocks to test expectations. For example, you might create a mock of a repository. And the test checks it calls the update function. You are testing a side effect. This is something you should avoid in functional languages. 

Instead of mocks we should use stubs. Mocking frameworks tend to treat them as interchangeable. This makes it hard to tell them apart. So it is good to have a simple definition. [Quoting](http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html) Martin Fowler:

* Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test. Stubs may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub that remembers the messages it 'sent', or maybe only how many messages it 'sent'.
* Mocks are objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive.

So what does Stubr provide:

* Stubr is not a mock framework
* Stubr is not a macro
* Stubr provides canned answers to calls made during a test
* Stubr makes it easy to create stubs
* Stubr makes sure the module you stub HAS the function you want to stub
* Stubr stubs as many functions and patterns as you want
* Stubr works without an explicit module. You set it up how you want
* Stubr lets you do asynchronous tests
* Stubr won't redefine your modules!
* Stubr has ZERO dependencies

## Example - Adapter for JSON PlaceHolder API

This is a simple JSONPlaceHolderAdapter built using TDD:

```elixir
defmodule Post do
  defstruct [:title, :body, :userId, :id]
end

defmodule JSONPlaceHolderAdapter do
  @posts_url "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"

  def get_post(id, http_client \\ HTTPoison) do
    "#{@posts_url}/#{id}"
    |> http_client.get
    |> handle_response
  end

  defp handle_response({:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{body: body, status_code: 200}}) do
    post = body
    |> Poison.decode!(as: %Post{})
    {:ok, post}
  end

  defp handle_response({:ok, _}) do
    {:error, "Bad request"}
  end

  defp handle_response({:error, _}) do
    {:error, "Something went wrong"}
  end
end

```

The injected `http_client` argument of `JSONPlaceHolderAdapter.get/1_post` defaults to `HTTPoison`. This is so we can create a stub using Stubr.

Stubr is good for using test data to define stubs. Pattern match on test data to create the function representations. Use Stubr to create the stub:

```elixir

@post_url "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"

@good_test_data [
  %{
    id: 1,
    post_url: "#{@post_url}/1",
    expected: %Post{title: "A title", body: "Some body", userId: 2, id: 1},
    canned_body: "{\"userId\": 2,\"id\": 1,\"title\": \"A title\",\"body\": \"Some body\"}"
  },
  %{
    id: 2,
    post_url: "#{@post_url}/2",
    expected: %Post{title: "Another title", body: "Some other body", userId: 3, id: 2},
    canned_body: "{\"userId\": 3,\"id\": 2,\"title\": \"Another title\",\"body\": \"Some other body\"}"
  }
]

test "If the call to get a post is successful, then a return post struct with id, userId, body and title" do
  
  # Dynamically build up the functions to stub. Alternatively, store them with the test data
  functions = @good_test_data
  |> Enum.map(
    fn %{post_url: post_url, canned_body: canned_body}
    # pin operator ^ is used to guarantee the correct response is returned
    -> {:get, fn(^post_url) -> {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{body: canned_body, status_code: 200}} end}
    end
  )

  http_client_stub = Stubr.stub(HTTPoison, functions)

  for %{id: id, expected: expected} <- @good_test_data do
    assert JSONPlaceHolderAdapter.get_post(id, http_client_stub) == {:ok, expected}
  end
end

```

The unsuccessful tests work in much the same way:

```elixir
@bad_test_data [
  %{id: 1, post_url: "#{@post_url}/1", status_code: 400},
  %{id: 2, post_url: "#{@post_url}/2", status_code: 500},
  %{id: 3, post_url: "#{@post_url}/3", status_code: 503}
]

test "If the response returns an invalid status code, then return error and a message" do
  functions = @bad_test_data
  |> Enum.map(
    fn %{status_code: status_code, post_url: post_url}
      -> {:get, fn(^post_url) -> {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{status_code: status_code}} end}
    end
  )

  http_client_stub = Stubr.stub(HTTPoison, functions)

  for %{id: id} <- @bad_test_data do
    assert JSONPlaceHolderAdapter.get_post(id, http_client_stub) == {:error, "Bad request"}
  end
end

test "If attempt to get data was unsuccessful, then return error and a message" do
  bad_response = {:get, fn(_) -> {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{}} end}

  http_client_stub = Stubr.stub(HTTPoison, [bad_response])

  assert JSONPlaceHolderAdapter.get_post(2, http_client_stub) == {:error, "Something went wrong"}
end

```

## Example - Creating Complex Stubs

Stubr can create complex stubs:

```elixir
stubbed = Stubr.stub([
  {:gravitational_acceleration, fn(:earth) -> 9.8 end},
  {:gravitational_acceleration, fn(:mars) -> 3.7 end},
  {:gravitational_acceleration, fn(:earth, :amsterdam) -> 9.813 end},
  {:gravitational_acceleration, fn(:earth, :havana) -> 9.788  end},
  {:gravitational_attraction, fn(m1, m2, r) -> Float.round(6.674e-11 *(m1 * m2) / (r * r), 3) end}
])

assert stubbed.gravitational_acceleration(:earth) == 9.8
assert stubbed.gravitational_acceleration(:mars) == 3.7
assert stubbed.gravitational_acceleration(:earth, :amsterdam) == 9.813
assert stubbed.gravitational_acceleration(:earth, :havana) == 9.788
assert stubbed.gravitational_attraction(5.97e24, 1.99e30, 1.5e11) == 3.523960986666667e22
```

## Installation

Stubr is [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/stubr), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `stubr` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:stubr, "~> 1.0.1"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `stubr` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:stubr]]
    end
    ```
