# Stubr

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leighshepperson/stubr.svg?branch=master)

Stubr lets you define module stubs and spies. Here, a **module stub** provides canned answers to
function calls and a **module spy** records inputs and outputs to function calls. Another way to think
of Stubr is as a collection of convenience functions that let you create mocks as nouns, as in the
article [mocks and explicit contracts](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/10/mocks-and-explicit-contracts/).

Stubr is entierly written in Elixir and has no dependencies on other libraries. Additionally, you can safely run
your tests asynchronously.

## Installation

Stubr is [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/stubr), the package can be installed as:

Add `stubr` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:stubr, "~> 1.3.5", only: :test}]
end
```

## Example - Random numbers

```elixir
    describe "stub :rand" do
      test "can stub :rand.uniform/1" do
        rand_stub = Stubr.stub!([uniform: fn _ -> 1 end], module: :rand)

        assert rand_stub.uniform(4) == 1
      end
    end

```

## Example - Timex

```elixir
describe "stub Timex" do
  test "can stub Timex.now/0" do
    fixed_time = Timex.to_datetime({2999, 12, 30})

    timex_stub = Stubr.stub!([now: fn -> fixed_time end], module: Timex)

    assert timex_stub.now == fixed_time
  end

  test "can stub Timex.now/0 and defer to un-stubbed Timex functions" do
    fixed_time = Timex.to_datetime({2999, 12, 30})

    timex_stub = Stubr.stub!([now: fn -> fixed_time end], module: Timex, auto_stub: true)

    assert timex_stub.before?(fixed_time, timex_stub.shift(fixed_time, days: 1))
  end
end

```

## Example - HTTPoison

```elixir
describe "stub HTTPoison" do
  setup do
    http_poison_stub = Stubr.stub!([
      get: fn("www.google.com") -> {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{body: "search", status_code: 200}} end,
      get!: fn("www.nasa.com") -> %HTTPoison.Response{body: "space", status_code: 500} end,
      post: fn("www.nasa.com", "content") -> {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{id: nil, reason: :econnrefused}} end
    ], module: HTTPoison)

    [stub: http_poison_stub]
  end

  test "can stub HTTPoison.get/1", context do
    {:ok, response} = context[:stub].get("www.google.com")

    assert response.body == "search"
    assert response.status_code == 200
  end

  test "can stub HTTPoison.get!/1", context do
    response = context[:stub].get!("www.nasa.com")

    assert response.body == "space"
    assert response.status_code == 500
  end

  test "can stub HTTPoison.post/1", context do
    {:error, error} = context[:stub].post("www.nasa.com", "content")

    assert error.id == nil
    assert error.reason == :econnrefused
  end

end

```

## Example - Creating Complex Stubs

Create stubs with functions of different arity, argument patterns and names:

```elixir
stubbed = Stubr.stub!([
  gravitational_acceleration: fn(:earth) -> 9.8 end,
  gravitational_acceleration: fn(:mars) -> 3.7 end,
  gravitational_acceleration: fn(:earth, :amsterdam) -> 9.813 end,
  gravitational_acceleration: fn(:earth, :havana) -> 9.788  end,
  gravitational_attraction: fn(m1, m2, r) -> 6.674e-11 * (m1 * m2) / (r * r) end
])

assert stubbed.gravitational_acceleration(:earth) == 9.8
assert stubbed.gravitational_acceleration(:mars) == 3.7
assert stubbed.gravitational_acceleration(:earth, :amsterdam) == 9.813
assert stubbed.gravitational_acceleration(:earth, :havana) == 9.788
assert stubbed.gravitational_attraction(5.97e24, 1.99e30, 1.5e11) == 3.523960986666667e22
```

## Example - Auto-Stub

Auto-stub modules by setting the `auto_stub` option to true. In this case, if you have not provided a function to stub, it will defer to the original implementation:

```elixir
stubbed = Stubr.stub!([
  ceil: fn 0.8 -> :stubbed_return end,
  parse: fn _ -> :stubbed_return end,
  round: fn(_, 1) -> :stubbed_return end,
  round: fn(1, 2) -> :stubbed_return end
], module: Float, auto_stub: true)

assert stubbed.ceil(0.8) == :stubbed_return
assert stubbed.parse("0.3") == :stubbed_return
assert stubbed.round(8, 1) == :stubbed_return
assert stubbed.round(1, 2) == :stubbed_return
assert stubbed.round(1.2) == 1
assert stubbed.round(1.324, 2) == 1.32
assert stubbed.ceil(1.2) == 2
assert stubbed.ceil(1.2345, 2) == 1.24
assert stubbed.to_string(2.3) == "2.3"
```

## Example - Call Information

If the `call_info` option is true, then you can use the function `Stubr.call_info` to get call information about the stub:

```elixir
stubbed = Stubr.stub!([
  ceil: fn 0.8 -> :stubbed_return end,
  parse: fn _ -> :stubbed_return end,
  round: fn(_, 1) -> :stubbed_return end,
  round: fn(1, 2) -> :stubbed_return end
], module: Float, auto_stub: true, call_info: true)

stubbed.ceil(0.8)
stubbed.parse("0.3")
stubbed.round(8, 1)
stubbed.round(1, 2)
stubbed.round(1.2)
stubbed.round(1.324, 2)
stubbed.ceil(1.2)
stubbed.ceil(1.2345, 2)
stubbed.to_string(2.3)

assert Stubr.call_info(stubbed, :ceil) == [
  %{input: [0.8], output: :stubbed_return},
  %{input: [1.2], output: 2.0},
  %{input: [1.2345, 2], output: 1.24}
]

assert Stubr.call_info(stubbed, :parse) == [
  %{input: ["0.3"], output: :stubbed_return}
]

assert Stubr.call_info(stubbed, :round) == [
  %{input: [8, 1], output: :stubbed_return},
  %{input: [1, 2], output: :stubbed_return},
  %{input: [1.2], output: 1.0},
  %{input: [1.324, 2], output: 1.32}
]

assert Stubr.call_info(stubbed, :to_string) == [
  %{input: [2.3], output: "2.3"}
]
```

## Example - Behaviours

In [http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/10/mocks-and-explicit-contracts/](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/10/mocks-and-explicit-contracts/) JosÃ© Valim writes about finding "proper contracts and proper boundaries between the components" in your system. This is something Stubr can help you with to accomplish a "behaviour first" version of TDD.

For example, let's say you want to call an internal API and you decide to use an adapter to wrap it up. However, you haven't built the adapter yet, so you stub it out as an injected dependency without worrying about the implementation details.

So we might have something like this:

```elixir
adapter_stub = Stubr.stub!([
  get: fn("url") -> {:ok, "result"} end,
  put: fn("url", "data") -> {:ok} end
])

# calls the get and put functions on the adapter stub
foo(adapter_stub)
```

Immediately, this suggests that the adapter needs a behaviour that looks something like this:

```elixir
defmodule AdapterBehaviour do
  @callback get(url :: String.t) :: {:ok, String.t}
  @callback put(url :: String.t, data :: String.t) :: {:ok}
end
```

So we can "clip" this on to the stub using the behaviour option:

```elixir
adapter_stub = Stubr.stub!([
  get: fn("url") -> {:ok, "result"} end,
  put: fn("url", "data") -> {:ok} end
], behaviour: AdapterBehaviour)
```

If the generated stub does not implement the behaviour, then it throws the usual compiler warning.

After we've completed all our tests, we can now implement the adapter and ensure it implements the `AdapterBehaviour`:

```elixir
defmodule Adapter do
  @behaviour AdapterBehaviour

  def get(url), do: #call the internal API
  def put(url, data), do: #call the internal API
end
```

The good thing about this is:

If you change the `Adapter`, then you should change the `AdapterBehaviour`. Since this will cause a compile time warning for the stub, it will encourage you to fix it, making your stubs and unit tests much less brittle.

## Roadmap

* Return different values for different calls of the same function
* "Was called with" functions
* "Was called with matching pattern" functions
* Callbacks
